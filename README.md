## Description
AprilFitDays was inspired by this pandemic. I don't know about you, but I love doign group fitness workouts!
The main reason being, I don't need to think about what moves to do! In group fitness workouts, you just show up,
focus on your form and get a good sweat in! 

Unfortunately with the pandemic and social distancing, it's a bit of a challenge to hold these sessions. 
Hence the creation of this app! AprilFitDays is a library of follow-along videos that provides you with a log
of your completed workouts.

You also have the abilty to become a creator and contribute to the community by uploading your own follow-along videos!
